# TikTok KOL Relevance Matcher

The goal of this project is to create a tool for finding and ranking TikTok influencers based on their relevance to a given brand, utilizing Thai and Eng Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Key Features

* **Influencer Data Processing:** Reads and manages influencer data from JSON sources.

* **Text Preprocessing:**
    * Removes emojis, numbers, and irrelevant symbols from text (like bios and video descriptions).
    * Converts text to lowercase.

* **Thai NLP (Natural Language Processing):**
    * **Thai Word Tokenization:** Uses `PyThaiNLP` to accurately split Thai text into individual words.
    * **Thai Stop Word Removal:** Filters out common, less meaningful words to highlight key terms.

* **Relevance Scoring:**
    * Employs **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** to transform brand and influencer texts into numerical vectors.
    * Uses **Cosine Similarity** to measure the resemblance between brand and influencer text vectors.

* **Influencer Ranking:**
    * Calculates a `total_score` by weighting the `relevance_score` and `authorMeta.fans` (follower count) to identify influencers who are both relevant and impactful.

* **Data Export:** Converts the final results into a CSV file for further analysis or use.

## How to Use It

1.  **Prep Your Influencer Data:**
    * Grab your influencer data (from Apify or wherever you sourced it) and make sure it's in a CSV and column header like in the dataset.
    * for my tiktok dataset i got it from apify, its called TikTok Scraper.
    * once you runned it, choose authors under the output to get EXACT columns as mine and export it as CSV.

2.  **Define Your Brand's Product Categories/Keywords:
    * Instead of a long, flowy description, you should provide a set of specific keywords that describe your brand's product category or niche.
    * For example, if your brand is Coke, you might use keywords from the search results like "à¸­à¸²à¸«à¸²à¸£à¹€à¸œà¹‡à¸”" (spicy food) and "à¹€à¸„à¸£à¸·à¹ˆà¸­à¸‡à¸”à¸·à¹ˆà¸¡" (drinks). This helps the model quickly understand your target niche and find influencers who talk about those specific topics.

3.  **Run the Script!!!**
    * You will need to install libraries such as --> pandas,apify-client,python-dotenv,pythainlp(for thai lang),scikit-learn,nltk(for eng)
    * By using pip install 'name' 

4.  **Check Out the Results:**
    * The script will print a neat table of ranked influencers (sorted by their `total_score`) right there in your console.

So when you run the script, you'll get a super cool table printed out. This table will show you a ranked list of influencers, with the most relevant ones right at the top! Here's what you'll see for each influencer:

* `authorMeta.name`: The influencer's name.

* `authorMeta.fans`: How many followers they've got.

* `relevance_score`: This is super important! It's a score from 0 to 1, telling you how well their content matches your brand. Higher is better.

* `total_score`: This is the final score we use to rank them. It's a mix of how relevant they are and how many fans they have.

Basically, the influencers with the highest `total_score` are your top picks.
